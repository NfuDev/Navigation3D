# Navigation3D

This is a simple plugin for Unreal Engine for 3D pathfinding.

Install Insutructions:

1. If you don't already have an Unreal Engine project created, create one and then close Unreal after it's created.
2. Clone or download the plugin from github
3. Copy and paste the "Plugins" folder from the download into the root of your Unreal Engine project direction (next to your .uproject, Content folder, etc...)
4. Launch your project. You may get a popup saying "The following modules are missing or built with a different engine version" and asking if you'd like to rebuild them. If so, press Yes.
5. The plugin is now added to your project
